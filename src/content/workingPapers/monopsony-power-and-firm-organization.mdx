Labor market competition drastically differs for production workers and managers. We extend a general equilibrium model of oligopsony with minimum wages to include firm organization and production complementarities across occupations. Using administrative data from Portugal, we estimate the model and validate it against quasi-experimental evidence on oligopsony and minimum wage effects. Relative to the efficient economy, monopsony reduces employment and wages, particularly for managers at the most productive firms. Managers' monopsony alone accounts for one-fifth of employment and wage losses for production workers. Welfare losses from monopsony are 3.4 and 2.4 percent for managers and production workers, respectively. Production workers bear smaller losses because they often work in markets with more competitor firms, view firms as closer substitutes, and are more affected by the minimum wage.
