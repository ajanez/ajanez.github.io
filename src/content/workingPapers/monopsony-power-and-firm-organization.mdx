Labor market competition drastically differs for production workers and managers. We extend a general equilibrium model of oligopsony with minimum wages to include firm organization and production complementarities across occupations. Using matched employer-employee data linked to balance sheet information of Portuguese firms, we estimate the model and validate it against quasi-experimental evidence on oligopsony and minimum wage effects. Relative to the efficient economy, monopsony power reduces employment, wages, and employment concentration, particularly for managers. Welfare losses are 3.4 and 2.4 percent for managers and production workers, respectively. Production workers bear smaller losses because they work in markets with more competitor firms, view firms as closer substitutes, and are more likely to be bound by the minimum wage. Production complementarities imply that monopsony over managers alone explains one-fifth of production workers' earnings losses.
