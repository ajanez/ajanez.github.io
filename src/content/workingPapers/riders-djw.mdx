Digital platforms typically operate through a controversial business model that relies on subcontracting self-employed workers. We develop an equilibrium model of the labor market to quantify the effects of the Spanish Riders’ Law in 2021, which establishes the presumption of dependent employment for food delivery couriers, known as riders. Heterogeneous riders trade off work flexibility and easier employability as self-employed against higher hourly wages as employees. We find that the reform failed in fully absorbing the large outflows from self-employment or in increasing wages. However, complementing the reform with a payroll tax cut for complier platforms preserves riders’ welfare levels.
