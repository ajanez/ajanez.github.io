When opportunities vary across locations and mobility is frictional, economic outcomes depend on birthplace. Using Spanish micro data and a life-cycle model, we show that location differences mainly reflect variation in (i) skill accumulation, (ii) job stability and opportunities, and (iii) information about alternative locations. For young individuals, information costs are the main barrier to mobility. Consequently, transfers to residents of distressed areas reduce inequality in economic outcomes with little effect on mobility. In contrast, policies that financially incentivize moving to high-opportunity locations increase inequality and do not significantly raise mobility toward those locations.
